# LISA 2025 Challenge 2b: Basal Ganglia Segmentation  
**Automated segmentation of bilateral basal ganglia structures in low-field (0.064T) pediatric brain MRI using nnU-Net**

## Overview

This project is my submission to the **RISE MICCAI LISA 2025 Low-Field MRI Segmentation Challenge** (Track 2b).

The challenge focuses on segmenting the **bilateral basal ganglia** in **0.064T pediatric brain MRIs**. These ultra-low-field scans are much noisier and lower in resolution than conventional clinical MRIs (1.5Tâ€“3T), but are more accessible in low-resource healthcare settings.
